**Brief description of the project:**

*NB: I know that this is more an article abstract and that is not really what we are looking for here. I wuld have to change it eventually.*

Natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as fire, logging and insect epidemics have a significant impact on population dynamics in forest ecosystems. These disturbances can lead to changes not only in species abundance and composition, but also in forest structure and ecosystem functions [@kuuluvainen2021; @viljur2022]. Secondary succession is an ecological process that can occur after a major disturbance in a forest. Plant communities recover gradually, starting with the establishment of pioneer species, mostly shade intolerant [@finegan1984]. Over time, these give way to more tolerant species such as sugar maple and American beech [@burns1990; @nolet2008]. This process leads to the formation of more mature and stable species communities, which eventually reach a state of equilibrium known as climax [@horn1974]. In Quebec, the territory is divided into bioclimatic domains corresponding to late-successional stands in mesic environments [@ministèredesressourcesnaturellesetdesforêts2022].

The study area, located on the west shore of Lac Croche at the Station de biologie des Laurentides (SBL) of the Université de Montréal, is in the bioclimatic range of the yellow birch maple stand [@ministèredesressourcesnaturellesetdesforêts2022]. However, it has been found that yellow birch maple stands are practically non-existent on the territory [@savage2001]. Interesting questions then arise... If the ecoforest communities are not yellow birch maple stands, what are they? What ecological processes are responsible for the composition of ecoforest communities in the study area? At what spatial scales do they operate?
